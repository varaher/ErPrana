The trajectory details the transition of the ErMate application to ErPrana, focusing on initial feature development and subsequent bug fixes. The previous AI engineer implemented UI/UX improvements, LLM integration (GPT-4o-mini), wearables sync, voice assistant, and a health care professional mode. A major issue surfaced regarding a  syntax error in  during the Symptom Interview Engine implementation. The current AI successfully debugged and resolved this syntax error by identifying and removing misplaced  statements, restoring the application to a stable state. Following this, the user reported ARYA's generic responses and conversation looping, requesting the integration of a detailed medical knowledge framework. The AI adopted a structured conversation flow (from a Cursor analysis) to fix the looping, implemented point-wise recommendations, and added emergency detection (e.g., for SAH). The latest effort involves ensuring infinite conversation flow, similar to ChatGPT, across all medical conditions.

<product_requirements>
The ErPrana application, an Emergency Medicine Assistant with Voice AI, needs to support two modes: Layperson (symptom checker, vitals, SOS, health records, wearables) and Doctor. Key features include a mandatory login, a full-page ChatGPT-style symptom checker with a concise ARYA greeting, wearables data sync prompts, and user profiles. The symptom checker must follow a structured medical approach (Chief complaint → Vitals → HPI → PMHx, etc.), provide 5 provisional diagnoses with triage risk and recommendations, intelligently understand user input, maintain conversation state, avoid repetitive questions, integrate comprehensive medical knowledge (9-system framework), and detect emergencies. Safety and privacy require user/third-party confirmation before data use and safety disclaimers. Medication management (lists and reminders) is also required.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI/Python (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Emergent LLM (GPT-4o-mini) for conversational AI.
-   **Medical Knowledge Integration**: Structured clinical knowledge bases for medical reasoning.
-   **Stateful Conversation Management**: Multi-turn dialogue, step-by-step progression, slot-filling.
-   **Containerization**: Kubernetes environment.
-   **UI/UX**: ChatGPT-style interfaces, responsive design.

<code_architecture>

-   : Main FastAPI application.
    -   Integrates routes and handles global CORS.
    -   **Changes**: Manages conversation state ( dict) and routes messages to  based on .
-   : Core backend logic for LLM-powered NLU and medical reasoning.
    -   **Changes**: Initially had issues with conversation flow. Heavily modified to implement a structured, step-by-step conversation ( to ). Includes , , , , ,  helper functions. Formats medical assessments and now includes  and  for ongoing dialogue and emergency detection (e.g., SAH).
-   : Contains the structured medical knowledge.
    -   **Changes**: Created to integrate the user-provided 9-system medical framework. Used by  for symptom analysis.
-   : Frontend component for the ChatGPT-style symptom checker.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed a critical  syntax error (lines 584, 599-600) that caused compilation failures. Overhauled to integrate with the new structured backend conversation flow, track , and display point-wise recommendations. Temporarily reverted to a simple version to restore preview and then reimplemented more robustly.
-   : Main React component, handles routing.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed an issue where  was being rendered simultaneously with  on the symptom checker view.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement full voice assistant functionality for ARYA (TTS minor API key issue still exists).
-   Implement full offline functionality using service workers and local storage.
-   Complete the functionality of the health care professional mode (separate UI, backend access for doctor data input).
-   Address any remaining backend API connectivity issues for the frontend, as it previously relied on client-side local processing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the ARYA Symptom Checker's conversational capabilities. The user reported issues where the chatbot was getting stuck in loops and not providing proper follow-up after a medical assessment, along with a request for point-wise recommendations and immediate emergency detection (specifically for SAH).

The AI engineer implemented a structured conversation approach based on a Cursor analysis (internal sub-agent suggestion), breaking the symptom intake process into distinct steps (initial assessment, symptom details, duration/timing, severity, associated symptoms, medical assessment). This approach aimed to prevent repetition and maintain conversation state.

Specifically, the  file was heavily modified to:
-   Define a  with specific handlers for each step.
-   Ensure  always leads to a  step.
-   Introduce a  function to specifically address post-assessment queries, including a robust emergency alert for keywords like SAH or worst headache.
-   Introduce a  function to manage various types of follow-up questions (new symptoms, clarification, treatment, prevention).
-   The  function was updated to present recommendations in a point-wise format and to include a ChatGPT-style prompt for continuous conversation.

The  was updated to correctly manage and route the  step. The  was also modified to reflect this continuous conversation state and urgency levels dynamically.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to test the implemented changes on the frontend to ensure infinite conversation flow, point-wise recommendations, and SAH emergency detection are working as intended.
