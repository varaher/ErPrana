The trajectory details the phased development of the ErPrana Emergency Medicine Assistant with Voice AI application. The initial request was to integrate an LLM (OpenAI GPT-4o) and a feedback mechanism (Phase 1). This involved creating new backend routes (), updating the  to use GPT-4o, and modifying the frontend  to include feedback buttons and API calls. A critical bug was found where the frontend passed a numeric  while the backend expected a string, which was resolved by type casting on the frontend.

Next, Phase 2 focused on creating an Advanced Medical Knowledge with Adaptive Learning system. This involved creating a new  and an  route, integrating them into the core symptom intelligence logic, and adding a detailed feedback modal to the frontend.

Phase 3 implemented Intelligent Wearable Medical Analytics. New backend modules () were created to analyze wearable data against provided medical knowledge and generate health reports. A corresponding  component was added to the frontend. This phase required significant debugging to fix backend Enum and ObjectId serialization errors identified by the testing agent. The most recent user request is to integrate a more advanced medical intelligence code snippet and enhance natural language understanding.

<product_requirements>
The ErPrana application is an Emergency Medicine Assistant with Voice AI with two modes: Layperson and Doctor. Key features include mandatory user login, a full-page ChatGPT-style symptom checker named ARYA, and user profiles. The core requirement is for ARYA to conduct a structured medical conversation (Chief Complaint, HPI, PMHx, etc.), provide provisional diagnoses with triage risk, and maintain conversational context to avoid repetition.

The system must integrate a comprehensive 9-system medical knowledge framework, intelligently detect emergencies (e.g., overdose, SAH), and handle multiple symptoms. Recent enhancements include an adaptive learning mechanism based on user feedback and an intelligent analytics engine for wearable data. This engine generates daily, weekly, and monthly health reports by correlating wearable data with the user's health records and past consultations. The overall goal is a robust, context-aware AI that provides safe, reliable medical guidance and escalates emergencies appropriately.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Frameworks**: React.js for the frontend and FastAPI (Python) for the backend.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **AI/ML**: LLM integration using OpenAI's GPT-4o for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and intelligent medical assessment.
- **State Management**: Server-side stateful conversation management to maintain context during user interactions.
- **Containerization**: The application is deployed in a Kubernetes container environment.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



- ****:
  - **Importance**: This is the core of the application's medical AI. It manages the conversational flow, state, and integration with the LLM (GPT-4o) and the structured medical knowledge framework.
  - **Changes**: Heavily modified to transition from a basic rule-based system to a sophisticated, multi-step conversational AI. It now includes functions for LLM-powered analysis (), emergency detection (overdose, SAH), and generation of comprehensive medical assessments. It was updated to integrate the .

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main entry point for the FastAPI application. It initializes the app, sets up CORS, and includes all the API routers from the  directory.
  - **Changes**: Updated multiple times to include new routers for feedback (), adaptive learning (), and wearable intelligence ().

- ****:
  - **Importance**: A new module created in Phase 3. It contains the logic for analyzing wearable data (sleep, heart rate, SpO₂, etc.) based on the extensive medical knowledge provided by the user.
  - **Changes**: Created and then heavily patched to fix Enum serialization issues by ensuring all triage levels were returned as strings instead of Enum objects.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The primary user interface for interacting with the ARYA AI. It manages the chat display, user input, and API calls to the backend.
  - **Changes**: Updated to include feedback buttons (thumbs up/down) and a detailed feedback modal. The API call logic was corrected to ensure the  is passed as a string to match backend Pydantic model requirements.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: A new component added in Phase 3 to display the analysis of the user's wearable data.
  - **Changes**: Created from scratch to provide visualizations and reports for daily, weekly, and monthly health data.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The root component of the React application. It handles routing and renders the main components based on the current view.
  - **Changes**: Modified to add a navigation link to the new  and to correctly render it as a new view within the application.

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate the user-provided advanced medical intelligence code to replace or enhance the current .
- Implement a natural language understanding layer (e.g., using Google Translate or similar services) to interpret colloquial user descriptions of symptoms (e.g., surrounding is spinning -> giddiness).
- Fix the final identified issue: ObjectId serialization in the health memory retrieval endpoint.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The engineer has just completed Phase 3, which involved building the Intelligent Wearable Medical Analytics system. This major feature required creating new backend logic and API endpoints to process wearable data using a comprehensive medical knowledge base.

**Backend Work:**
- New files were created:  and .
- These files contain the logic to analyze various health metrics (sleep, heart rate, SpO₂, etc.) and assign triage levels (RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN).
- A new route, , was added to expose this functionality.

**Frontend Work:**
- A new component, , was created to display the analyzed health data in daily, weekly, and monthly reports.
- The main  was updated to include navigation to this new dashboard.

**Debugging:**
- The initial implementation faced critical backend errors related to returning Python Enum objects in API responses, which are not JSON serializable. This was fixed by converting all triage level enums to strings before returning them from the API.
- A similar issue was found where the  was trying to perform a  operation on Enum objects, which was also fixed.
- The most recent test run revealed a remaining issue with MongoDB  serialization in the health memory retrieval logic.

Immediately before this summary, the user provided a new, more advanced code snippet for medical intelligence and requested its integration along with an enhancement for natural language understanding. The engineer's last action was acknowledging this new request and stating the plan to first fix the remaining ObjectId bug from Phase 3 testing.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the ObjectId serialization issue in the health memory retrieval endpoint, as identified in the last test run, to ensure the wearable intelligence system is fully functional before integrating the new medical intelligence code.
