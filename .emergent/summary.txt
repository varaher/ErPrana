The trajectory documents the evolution of the ErPrana application's core medical AI, ARYA. The initial user request was to fix conversational loops and enhance the AI to collect multiple symptoms before providing numbered, reasoned recommendations. The first attempt involved creating a new advanced API, but user testing revealed persistent loops and context-awareness failures.

The user then provided a sophisticated, structured interview architecture, starting with a Fever script. This new paradigm uses a finite state machine, defined in JSON policy files, and a slot-filling mechanism, defined in JSON rule files. This approach eliminates loops by design and ensures a clinically relevant line of questioning.

The AI engineer successfully refactored the entire backend to support this new architecture. This involved creating new core modules:  (the interview engine),  (the diagnostic engine), and  (the main orchestrator).

Following the success of the fever implementation, the engineer integrated similar user-provided scripts for Chest Pain and Shortness of Breath (SOB). Significant debugging was required to make the interview engine complaint-agnostic and to fix entity extraction logic. A bug in the SOB triage calculation was identified but not fully resolved. The work concluded mid-implementation of the fourth script, Headache.

<product_requirements>
The ErPrana application, an Emergency Medicine Assistant with Voice AI, requires a robust, ChatGPT-style symptom checker named ARYA. The core requirement is to evolve ARYA from a simple conversational agent into a clinically structured decision support tool.

The system must conduct guided, non-repetitive interviews for specific chief complaints like fever, chest pain, and headache. It needs to intelligently gather information by filling predefined slots (e.g., duration, severity, associated symptoms). Based on the collected data, it must evaluate a set of clinical red-flag rules to determine a triage level (e.g., routine, urgent, emergency).

Finally, ARYA must generate a comprehensive summary that includes a list of potential provisional diagnoses with reasoning and provide clear, actionable, and symptom-specific recommendations. The entire system is designed to be modular, allowing for the easy addition of new medical interview scripts for different complaints.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Frameworks**: React.js (frontend), FastAPI (Python backend).
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing conversation state.
- **AI/ML**: LLM (GPT-4o) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and entity extraction within a structured flow.
- **State-Machine-Driven Interviews**: A custom-built engine using JSON-based configurations ( and ) to guide conversations through a finite set of states, ensuring no loops.
- **Slot-Filling Mechanism**: Extracts key medical entities from user input to populate a predefined data structure for each complaint.
- **Rule-Based Triage**: Evaluates collected symptoms against clinical red-flag rules defined in JSON to determine urgency.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's architecture was significantly refactored to support a modular, state-driven interview system. The core logic now resides in a new set of interconnected backend modules.



-   ****: This new directory stores the configuration for each medical interview.
    -    files: Define the slots to be filled, the questions to ask for each slot, red-flag rules, and summary templates.
    -    files: Define the finite state machine for each interview, controlling the flow of the conversation (e.g., GREETING -> CORE_HISTORY -> SUMMARY).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core engine that runs the interviews. It loads the JSON configurations, manages the conversation state, asks questions for the next unfilled slot based on the policy, extracts entities from user responses, and evaluates red flags.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch to implement the user-provided pseudocode. It was later refactored to be complaint-agnostic, dynamically loading the correct  and  files.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the new primary API endpoint () that the frontend interacts with. It acts as an orchestrator.
    -   **Changes**: Created to detect the user's chief complaint (e.g., fever, chest pain), initialize the correct interview state, call the  engine to conduct the interview turn, and then pass the final results to the  for diagnosis.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the logic for generating provisional diagnoses and comprehensive recommendations based on the final, filled slots from an interview.
    -   **Changes**: Created to analyze the structured data from multiple interviews, allowing it to correlate symptoms (e.g., fever + chest pain) for a more accurate diagnosis.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main user interface for the ARYA chatbot.
    -   **Changes**: The API call in the  function was updated to point to the new  endpoint, replacing the previous  endpoint.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of the Headache interview script by integrating it into the  and other relevant modules.
- Debug and fix the incorrect triage calculation for the Shortness of Breath interview, where risk factors are not correctly elevating the urgency level.
- Conduct comprehensive testing of the newly implemented Headache interview flow.

<current_work>
The engineer is in the middle of integrating the fourth user-provided medical interview script for Headache. The work so far has involved translating the user's TypeScript controller logic into the existing Python framework.

**File Creation:**
-   : Contains the slots, questions, and red-flag rules for the headache interview.
-   : Defines the conversational state machine for the headache interview.

**File Modifications:**
-   ****: Updated to recognize headache as a valid complaint and to include headache-specific entity extraction logic in the  function. The code now parses keywords related to headache onset, severity, and associated symptoms like fever or neck stiffness.
-   ****: The  method was enhanced to include keywords like headache and migraine to initiate the correct interview. The  method was updated to process and combine data from the headache interview with the overall patient state.

The immediate next step was to integrate the headache logic into the diagnostic engine and then begin testing.

<optional_next_step>
Update the  to include headache-related conditions and diagnoses, then restart the backend and test the full headache interview flow.
