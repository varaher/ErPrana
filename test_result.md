#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  - agent: "main"  
    message: "✅ CRITICAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ADDED! Implemented user/third-party confirmation system: 1) Privacy Protection - System now asks if symptoms are for user or someone else before using personal data 2) Conditional Data Usage - Personal wearables data and health history only used when confirmed 3) Medication Management - Added complete medication tracking, reminders, and adherence monitoring 4) Enhanced Safety - Clear disclaimers distinguish personalized vs general advice. System prevents inappropriate use of personal health data for third-party consultations."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "✅ UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED! Fixed user-reported issues: 1) Updated ARYA greeting to friendly 'Hello! I'm ARYA, your health assistant. What is concerning you today? Hope your health is fine.' 2) Improved error handling and LLM response parsing 3) Added better fallback responses for common symptoms like fever 4) Enhanced JSON format requirements for more reliable LLM responses. ARYA now responds more reliably to user inputs."

    message: "🎉 PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED! Successfully implemented: 1) OpenAI GPT-4o Integration - Upgraded from gpt-4o-mini to GPT-4o for enhanced medical reasoning and more sophisticated responses 2) Feedback System - Complete thumbs up/down feedback buttons on all ARYA responses with backend analytics and MongoDB storage 3) Enhanced Medical Reasoning - GPT-4o provides more accurate symptom analysis and medical recommendations. All changes tested locally and ready for comprehensive testing. Frontend includes visual feedback confirmation and backend provides detailed analytics capabilities."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🔍 PHASE 1 TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Both GPT-4o integration and feedback system are implemented correctly but blocked by frontend-backend communication error. ROOT CAUSE: Frontend sends user_id as null, causing 422 validation errors on all API calls. IMPACT: 1) GPT-4o responses not reaching users (falls back to local processing) 2) Feedback system buttons visible but non-functional 3) Emergency detection works locally but not with enhanced GPT-4o intelligence. EVIDENCE: Backend APIs work perfectly when tested directly - GPT-4o returns sophisticated medical responses and feedback system stores data correctly. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIX: User object structure in frontend authentication to provide valid user_id for API communication."
