#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "🔥 FEVER INTERVIEW CRITICAL ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED! ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The issue was in the integrated medical AI process order - conversational layer was intercepting follow-up answers before checking for active interviews. FIXED by prioritizing active interview detection BEFORE conversational layer checks. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS (6/6 tests passed): 1) Conversational Layer: 'hi' and 'good morning' correctly handled by conversational responses 2) Fever Detection: 'I have fever' and 'im having fever since 2 days' correctly trigger fever interview 3) Fever Interview Questions: System asks proper fever questions from fever.json ('Are you having a fever now or recently?' → 'Did it start suddenly or gradually?' → 'What was the highest temperature you recorded?') - NO PAIN QUESTIONS 4) Exact User Scenario: Complete flow tested - user says 'im having fever since 2 days' → ARYA asks proper fever questions, NOT 'Can you describe it? Is it sharp, dull, throbbing, or burning?' 5) Debug Analysis: Interview active, proper fever questions being asked 6) Slot Progression: Fever interview progresses through proper slots without interruption. ✅ CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED: Modified integrated_medical_ai.py to check for active interviews FIRST before conversational layer, preventing interference with ongoing medical interviews. The reported issue where ARYA asked pain characteristics for fever is now completely eliminated."

Core integration working but emergency escalation logic needs debugging. The 'includes' operation fix is working for data collection but not for triage rule evaluation."

    message: "🎯 CRITICAL EMERGENCY DETECTION TESTING COMPLETED - ALL FIXES VERIFIED WORKING! ✅ PRIMARY FOCUS SUCCESS: Thunderclap headache emergency detection ('I have a sudden severe headache, worst of my life') now triggers immediate RED emergency with SAH warning and 911 instructions BEFORE interview starts ✅ TERTIARY FOCUS SUCCESS: Meningitis emergency detection ('I have a headache with fever and stiff neck') correctly triggers immediate RED emergency ✅ SECONDARY FOCUS SUCCESS: Fixed critical SOB triage bug - boolean conversion issue in rule evaluation resolved (true/false → True/False), PE red flag now triggers correctly when all conditions met ✅ RULE EVALUATION FIX: Fixed _evaluate_rule_condition method to properly handle 'includes' operations and boolean conversions. EVIDENCE: 3/3 critical tests passing (100% success rate). All emergency detection patterns working as designed - immediate emergency for thunderclap/meningitis, interview-based escalation for SOB PE when criteria collected. Critical fixes successfully implemented and verified."

    message: "🔥 FEVER INTERVIEW CRITICAL ISSUE DEBUGGING COMPLETED - ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED! ✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: User reported 'im having fever since 2 days' → ARYA incorrectly responds 'Can you describe it? Is it sharp, dull, throbbing, or burning?' instead of proper fever questions. ROOT CAUSE: Conversational layer was intercepting follow-up answers before checking for active interviews, causing interview state loss. ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Modified integrated_medical_ai.py process_message method to prioritize active interview detection BEFORE conversational layer checks, preventing interference with ongoing medical interviews. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING (6/6 tests passed): 1) Conversational Layer: Greetings properly handled 2) Fever Detection: Both 'I have fever' and 'im having fever since 2 days' correctly trigger fever interview 3) Fever Interview Questions: System asks proper fever questions from fever.json - 'Are you having a fever now or recently?' → 'Did it start suddenly or gradually?' → 'What was the highest temperature you recorded?' 4) Exact User Scenario: Complete flow verified - NO MORE PAIN QUESTIONS for fever 5) Debug Analysis: Interview properly active with correct fever questions 6) Slot Progression: Interview continues without conversational layer interference. ✅ CRITICAL FIX VERIFIED: The reported issue where ARYA asked pain characteristics ('sharp, dull, throbbing, burning') for fever symptoms is now completely eliminated. Fever interview now works exactly as intended with proper questions from fever.json."
